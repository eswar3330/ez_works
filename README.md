# EZ Works Frontend Assignment

This project is a frontend implementation of the EZ Works landing page, created as part of a UI development test. It includes a responsive carousel, flip card section for USPs, and a contact form modal.

You can check out the live version here:  
https://ez-works-delta.vercel.app

## Whatâ€™s inside

- A responsive and interactive carousel of services
- Auto-play functionality for carousel with drag and indicator support
- USP cards with flip animation
- A contact form modal with proper validation
- Fully responsive design across screen sizes
- Built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Swiper.js

## How to run it locally

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/eswar3330/ez_works.git`

2. Go into the project folder  
   `cd ez_works`

3. Install the dependencies  
   `npm install`

4. Start the development server  
   `npm run dev`

The app will now be running on `http://localhost:5173` or whichever port Vite assigns.

## Postman Collection

I've included a Postman collection file in the root directory named `ez_works.postman_collection.json`.  
Right now itâ€™s just a placeholder as the backend endpoint for the contact form hasn't been implemented yet.

## Tech Stack Used

- React (with Vite)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Swiper.js for the carousel
- Lucide-react for icons

## Final Thoughts

This was a fun project to work on. The goal was to get the UI as close as possible to the given design. Hope you like it!
